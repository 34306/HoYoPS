# HoYoPS
Allows a certain space train anime game to connect to private servers
## Setup
1. Install tweak, and then open and close the game.
2. Open Filza and navigate to `/var/mobile/Containers/Data/Application/[GAME FOLDER]/Library`.
3. Inside should be a file called `server_config.plist` which you can edit to point to the server you want.
4. Save your changes and now when you open the game it should connect to the selected server.
## Plans
I hope to add real preferences as well as the other hoyo games in the future.
